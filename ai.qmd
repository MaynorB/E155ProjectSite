An aspect of this project was that we had permission to utilize AI for help. We used both Gemini and ChatGPT for aid. Specifcally, it aided in helping utilize the FATFS library, helping debug it to make sure we were reading the data correctly. They were helpful in helping clear out ideas as well, making sure we were going in the general direction we wanted. 

Some aspect we realized is how interesting it made the modules for the FPGA, where AI was generally good at doing the logic you ask for, but you have to tell it basically everything on how everything works so it does it correctly. It was also interesting it avoided using peripherals at all costs except for the RAM.
