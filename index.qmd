We are Carlos (ENGINEERING) and Maynor (COMPUTER SCIENCE), both Junior Mudders. For our E155 project, we decided to make a portable DJ set. Using the MCU and FPGA, we were able to apply a high or low pass filter, plus either speed up or slow down the song playing. With a click of the joystick, you can also skip the current song playing to the next one, looping through 16 songs.
