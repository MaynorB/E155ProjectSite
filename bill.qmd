## Parts List
Below is a table of the parts we used. Those with astricks are new hardware we used. While most of these are simple, specifcally the MicroSD reader and DAC module are new as we have not used either one of these. The MicroSD card introduces a new library while the DAC module brings a new type of logic that has been breifly covered.

## Schematic

In the following diagram, it is our electircal schmeatic on how we wired up our hardware. Note that our joystick we have reversed ground and 3.3V due to the signal sending the joystickn click being wire to ground for an unknown reason.

## FPGA Diragrams

The following diagrams are associated with our FPGA. Diagram 1 showcases our block modules used in the FPGA itself. Diagram 2 is the generated diagram provided by Radiant.
