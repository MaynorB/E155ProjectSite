    "text": "An aspect of this project was that we had permission to utilize AI for help. We used both Gemini and ChatGPT for aid. Specifcally, it aided in helping utilize the FATFS library, helping debug it to make sure we were reading the data correctly. They were helpful in helping clear out ideas as well, making sure we were going in the general direction we wanted.\nSome aspect we realized is how interesting it made the modules for the FPGA, where AI was generally good at doing the logic you ask for, but you have to tell it basically everything on how everything works so it does it correctly. It was also interesting it avoided using peripherals at all costs except for the RAM."

    "section": "Reading WAV",
    "text": "Reading WAV\nIn order to read the .wav file, we utilize a pre-made library titled FATFS. This easily allowed us to utilize premade function to read the microSD. However, it is not a high level, rather as a mediator for us to use. To put it simply, we still had to write a few functions to properly read the microSD card. Once we were past this, we decided to utilze SPI1 to communicate with the microSD reader. When recieving data, we made a 512 byte buffer to read in chunks. The reason with this is 512 bytes is the smallest size used in MicroSDs when it comes to reading sectors. This allows us to properly extract sectors without missing data and having a faster refresh rate for ADC data."

This would make it easier to send this data to the FPGA, and allow easy value calibration that would be harder to do using system verilog. With the click, we simply used a GPIO input."

However, we ran into the problem on how the data is being sent, as it would be difficult for the FPGA to tell when it has recieved wav or joystick data. This made us use 2 different chip selects, where one controls the Audio receiving and the other controls ADC data."
